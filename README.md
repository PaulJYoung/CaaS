# Cloud as a Service Website

The purpose of this site is to inform those who are interested on what Cloud actually is. The site is a built using Django web framework, and has been deployed to a popular Cloud service provider using native Docker containers. The containers run a MySQL service, Gunicorn web server, and Nginx reverse proxy.

## Deployment

I doubt that you would want to deploy this site, but you can however view it at www.cloudasaservice.co.uk

## Acknowledgments

* A huge 'tip of the hat' and massive thank you to Robert McCracken (www.outyear.co.uk) for being an outstanding web designer, and the architect of SMINT, which drives my web sites scrolling. Thank you very much Rob!! I even brazenly plagiarised Rob's design, he really is that good! Thanks again Rob.
* Cloud computing needs to be explained to people, otherwise assumptions are made that are nonesense, and the Cloud service providers will 'lap it up'
